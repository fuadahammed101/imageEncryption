Image Encryption and Decryption Using AES
This project demonstrates a secure image encryption and decryption process using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. It ensures data confidentiality by converting images into an unreadable format and allows accurate recovery with the correct key.

Features:
Encryption: Converts image data into secure, encrypted files using AES.
Decryption: Recovers the original image from the encrypted file using the same encryption key.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a Java-based GUI for easy interaction.
Secure Key Generation: Uses SHA-256 hashing to create a robust secret key.
How It Works:
Load an image file.
Enter a password to generate a secure encryption key.
Encrypt the image to generate a .enc file.
Decrypt the .enc file using the same password to restore the original image.
Technologies Used:
Java for GUI and implementation.
AES Algorithm for encryption/decryption.
SHA-256 Hashing for secure key generation.
This project is ideal for learning cryptographic principles and implementing secure data protection systems.
